%h1 Waiting for your co-writer

%p Ask him / her to join you at this url:

%ul
  %li= link_to @join_url, @join_url

%hr/

%p We heard you like them urlz, so we have one for you too:

%ul
  %li=  link_to @start_url, @start_url

%p
  But it takes two to Write the Scene... so you will keep getting back here untill your friend joins.

  %br/

  = "So what are you waiting for? #{link_to('Invite', @join_url)} your co-screenwriter friend already!".html_safe
